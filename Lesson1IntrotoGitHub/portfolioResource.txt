For the longest time I have always wanted to learn how to use GitHUB. Yeah I had my run ins with it and find a file here
and there to read over for a project. However, I never actually have made a repository before so something new! I am excited to learn
more about it and looking forward to using it as a sort of resume for my future opportunities. After all you can have enough coding work
show for any future opportunity.
